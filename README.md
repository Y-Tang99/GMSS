# GMSS (Ground Motion Simulation System)
This open-source software package is used for implementing stochastic ground motion simulations. Three different types of program are provided in this package. Type 1 (named "SSMainPro") is based on wrapper script running in MATLAB for the ground motion simulation of single earthquake scenario (Magnitude-Distance combination); Type 2 (named MSMainPro) is based on wrapper script running in MATLAB for the simulation of multiple scenarios; and Type 3 (named GMSSPro) is based on a GUI user-interface which can be executed as a standalone program, and the original GMSSPro.m file and GMSSPro.fig file which were used to generate the standalone program are also provided. 
This package is developed based on MATLAB 2019b and users need to accept the MATLAB Terms of Use. Any bugs can be reported to tangyuxiang56@gmail.com.
