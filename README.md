# GMSS (Ground Motion Simulation System)
This open-source software package is used for implementing stochastic ground motion simulations. Three different types are contained in this package: Type 1 (named "SSMainPro") is based on wrapper script running in MATLAB for the simulation of single earthquake Magenitude-Distance (M-R) combination, Type 2 (named MSMainPro) is also based on wrapper script running in MATLAB but for the simulation of multiple M-R combinations, and Type 3 (named GMSSPro) is based on a GUI user-interface, and can be executed as a standalone app, the original GMSSPro.m file and GMSSPro.fig file which were used to generate the standalone platform are also provided. 
This package is developed based on MATLAB 2019b. Any potential users need to accept the MATLAB Terms of Use. Any bugs can be reported to tangyuxiang56@gmail.com.
