# GMSS (Ground Motion Simluation System)
This open-source software package is used for implementing stochastic ground motion simulations. Three different versions are contained in this package: Version 1 is based on wrapper script running for single earthquake Magenitude-Distance (M-R) combination, Version 2 is also based on wrapper script running but for multiple M-R combinations, Version 3 is a standalone platform with a user-interface. 
This is a still in-progress product and will be updated in future. Any bugs can be reported to tangyuxiang56@gmail.com.
